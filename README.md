# score5al
Scoreboard application for Sur5al-style roller derby competitions

## About

This project was created by Liam McBrien in 2012 as a favour for the Royal Windsor Rollergirls. It displays a scoreboard for "Sur5al"-style roller derby competitions, and is intended to be displayed or projected on a large screen with a secondary screen (e.g. a laptop) used to control the software.

For more information, check out the online help within the application.

# How to run

Score5al requires a Java runtime - any currently-supported version will do. Java is a free programming language and platform. If you don't know how to install Java, I recommend you install the latest release package from: https://adoptium.net

Once you have installed a Java runtime, simply open the score5al-v1.0.jar file to run the software. There's a sample.s5l file provided if you want a demo competition.

# Development

I don't currently have any involvement with RWRG or roller derby in general and I do not maintain this project any more. I have dumped the latest development files I could find into this repository. Feel free to fork it if you want to make modifications or take it over. I've included the Eclipse project files - simply use the export option to create an executable JAR.
