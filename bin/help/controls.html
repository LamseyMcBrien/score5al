            <h2>Match Controls</h2>
			<p>
				This section of the user manual contains instructions on using
                Score5al's main window to set up your match and teams, create
                the jam schedule, and update jam scores. 
			</p>
      
            <p><b>Main Window Layout</b></p>
            <p>
                Like most desktop programs, Score5al has a menu bar which 
                contains various functions such as saving/loading matches, 
                viewing this help manual, and so on. There is also a toolbar 
                with quick-access buttons for common functions, as well as a 
                status bar at the bottom of the window which displays 
                context-sensitive help.
            </p>
            <p align="center">
                <img src="mainwindow.jpg" /><br />
                <i>Score5al's main window</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Score5al's match-editing controls are contained in four tabs, 
                one each for Match, Teams, Heats, and Jams. See below for more
                details on each of these tabs.
            </p>
            
            
            <p><b>Match-Editing Tabs</b></p>
            <p>
                Score5al's match-editing controls are separated into tabs, each
                of which allows you to manage one aspect of the match. Each tab
                is described briefly below; click the headings for complete 
                details.
            </p>
            <p><i><a href="match.html">Match</a></i></p>
            <p>
                The Match tab is used to set the match's overall parameters - 
                the match name, the numbers of teams, heats and jams, and the
                jam duration.
            </p>
            <p><i><a href="teams.html">Teams</a></i></p>
            <p>
                After selecting the desired number of teams, the Teams tab can
                be used to edit each team's details, including their name and
                colours.
            </p>
            <p><i><a href="heats.html">Heats</a></i></p>
            <p>
                The Heats tab is used to assign teams to the jams in each heat,
                thereby creating a match schedule.
            </p>
            <p><i><a href="jams.html">Jams</a></i></p>
            <p>
                On match day, the Jams tab is used to control the jam timer and
                update the scores for the jam in progress. The Jams tab also
                controls which jam or heat is being displayed in the scoreboard 
                window. 
            </p>
            
            <a name="menus"></a>
            <p><b>Menu Functions</b></p>
            <p>
                Score5al has three menus, each with various options; many of 
                the menu functions should be self-explanatory if you are 
                familiar with modern desktop applications. Read on for more
                information.
            </p>
            <p><i>Match menu</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>New, Load, Save, Save As</b> - these functions, which also
                    appear on the toolbar, allow you to perform normal load/save
                    operations with your match data. Match data is saved in a
                    special CSV-based format which is internal to Score5al; if
                    desired, these files can be hand-edited so long as the 
                    structure is not altered. Score5al save files have a 
                    <i>.s5l</i> filename extension.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Show distribution</b> - displays a dialog box which 
                    visualises the distribution of each team's jams throughout
                    the match schedule. See 
                    <a href="heats.html#distribution">Team Distribution</a> 
                    for more information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Export as CSV</b> - this function exports all match data
                    in a human-readable form to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
                    file which can be imported into a spreadsheet package such
                    as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice. The field delimiter is a 
                    comma and the quote delimiter is the double-quote character.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Export options</b> - this submenu allows you to choose
                    the format to use for team names in exported CSV files. For
                    example, you might want to use team numbers only to create
                    a compact schedule table, or you might want to use team 
                    names in a post-match results report.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Exit</b> - this closes the application. If there are
                    unsaved changes, you will be prompted to save or discard 
                    them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Scoreboard menu</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Jam / Schedule / Table mode</b> - these functions switch
                    the current scoreboard mode and also appear on the toolbar.
                    See the <a href="scoreboard.html">Scoreboard</a> section for
                    more details on scoreboard modes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Enter / exit full screen</b> - toggles the full-screen
                    status of the scoreboard. Pressing the ESC character quits
                    full-screen mode. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Help menu</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Help</b> - if you're reading this text, it's fairly 
                    likely that you already know what this menu item does; it 
                    opens the online help manual which you are currently reading.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>About</b> - displays version and copyright information

                    by this software.
