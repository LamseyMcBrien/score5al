            <h2>Scoreboard Window</h2>
			<p>
				Score5al's scoreboard window is designed to be displayed in 
                full-screen mode on a dedicated display, such as a projector
                or large screen. It can display various kinds of information 
                relevant to whatever is happening during the match. It doesn't 
                have any interactive elements and is controlled using the 
                <a href="controls.html">controls in the main window</a>. 
			</p>
      
            <p><b>Scoreboard modes</b></p>
            <p>
                The scoreboard has three different modes, each of which displays
                different information. You can switch between the modes at any
                time using the buttons in the toolbar or in the 'Scoreboard' 
                menu. Read on for a description of each mode.
            </p>
            <p><i>Jam Mode</i></p>
            <p>
                During a jam, the scoreboard window should be set to Jam Mode.
                In this mode, the scoreboard displays information about the jam
                which is currently selected in the 
                <a href="jams.html">Jams panel</a>. The names of the teams 
                involved in the jam are displayed along with their scores, using 
                the team colours chosen in the 
                <a href="teams.html">Teams panel</a>. Lead jammer status is 
                shown by a star next to the team's name. The jam timer is
                shown in the centre; it will turn red when 10 seconds or less 
                remain.
            </p>

                <i>Score5al's scoreboard in Jam Mode</i>
            </p>
            <p><i>Schedule Mode</i></p>
            <p>
                In Schedule Mode, the scoreboard will display the jam schedule 
                for the heat which is currently selected in the 
                <a href="jams.html">Jams panel</a>. If a jam has already been
                completed, the scores will be displayed instead of the "vs." 
                text. This allows Schedule Mode to provide a summary of the 
                results in a completed heat, or a preview of the running 
                order in an uncompleted heat, or even both, in the case of an 
                partially-completed heat.

            <p>
                 To display the overall match scores, place the scoreboard into
                 Table Mode. This displays the match rankings in the style of a
                 league table. The teams are ordered by their position in the 
                 match. The columns displayed are, from left to right: Rank,
                 Team name/number, Wins, Draws, Losses, Led Jams, Points 
                 Difference (jam points scored minus jam points conceded), and
                 overall Match Points. See the 
                 <a href="intro.html">introduction</a> for more information 
                 about match scoring.

            </p>
            
            
            <p><b>Using the Scoreboard Window</b></p>
            <p>
                Score5al is designed to be used on a system with two screens, 
                such as a laptop with a projector connected in addition to its
                inbuilt screen. The main window is displayed on one screen (e.g
                the laptop screen), while the scoreboard window is displayed on
                another (e.g. the projector).
            </p>
            <p>
                To show the scoreboard window, select the desired mode (Jam, 
                Schedule, or Table). You should then place the scoreboard window
                on the screen where you want to show it, and select the "Full 
                Screen Mode" option from the main window's Scoreboard menu. 
                Depending on your operating system and your graphics hardware, 
                this may or may not actually take up the entire screen; it has
                been tested on Windows 7 and Solaris 11 and works as intended 
                on these systems.
            </p>
            <a name="hints"></a>
            <p><i>Hints and tips</i></p>
            <p>
                If you accidentally hide the main window by placing the 
                scoreboard window into full-screen mode on the wrong screen, you
                can disable full-screen mode by pressing the Escape key.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scoreboard window has been designed to work on all standard
                computer display aspect ratios - 5:4, 4:3, 16:10, and 16:9 - at
                any screen resolution. Depending on the fonts used by your OS,
                your experience may differ. If you experience problems with 
                truncated text in Schedule or Table mode, you can tweak the
                sizes of the table columns by resizing the table headers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are not able to use Score5al in the intended setup with
                one system and two screens (for example, because your projector
                input is located in a different room), it is suggested that you
                use desktop-sharing software such as VNC or Remote Desktop to
                work around this.
