            <h2>Introduction to Score5al</h2>
			<p>
				Score5al is a scoreboard program for roller derby events which 
                use the Sur5al format. This introduction briefly covers the 
                Sur5al concepts which are relevant to using this software; for 
                more information about Sur5al, please contact the 
                <a href="http://www.windsorrollergirls.com">Royal Windsor Rollergirls</a>
                and ask for an information pack.

            <p><b>Sur5al Concepts</b></p>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional roller derby matches, which involve two teams
                with a large pool of players, Sur5al events typically involve a
                large number of teams which each consist of only five players,
                and each team plays each other team once (or more) in a match.
                This is the reason for Score5al's existence - standard scoreboard
                software doesn't work well for the Sur5al format.
            </p>
            <p><i>Schedule</i></p>
            <p>
                Sur5al matches have a jam schedule which ensures that each team
                plays each other team for the appropriate number of jams. For a
                major Sur5al event, there are typically 15 teams, and every team
                plays each other team once, for a total of 105 jams.
            </p>
            <p>
                To aid with space and logistics, Sur5al matches are usually 
                divided into heats. Each heat comprises a small number of jams,
                and the number of teams participating in a heat is kept to a 
                certain limit; for a 15-team event, there are normally 15 heats
                of 7 jams each, and each heat involves a maximum of 6 teams.
            </p>
            <p><i>Scoring</i></p>
            <p>
                Jam scoring is similar in Sur5al to normal roller derby matches
                - jammer points dictate which team wins a jam. For each jam won,
                teams gain 5 match points; draws are worth 2 match points to 
                both teams. The team with the largest total of match points at 
                the end of the match wins the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike normal derby matches, all Sur5al jams last two minutes;
                the lead jammer may not "call off" the jam. However, lead jammer
                status is still important, as a bonus match point is awarded to
                the team which secures lead jammer status.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event of teams being tied on match points, the teams' 
                points difference ('jam points scored' minus 'jam points 
                conceded') is used as a tie-breaker. If both teams are still 
                tied, then the number of jam wins is used. Finally, if still 
                tied, then the number of jams led is used.
            </p>

            <p><b>Score5al Concepts</b></p>
            <p>
                Since the Sur5al format introduces a number of new concepts over
                a normal roller derby match, Score5al offers various 
                Sur5al-centric features.
            </p>
            <p><i>Interface</i></p>
            <p>
                Score5al's interface is split into two windows. The main program 
                window contains <a href="controls.html">controls</a> for setting 
                up the match and editing jam scores, while the 
                <a href="scoreboard.html">scoreboard window</a> is designed to be 
                displayed on a projector or other large screen during the match.
            </p>
            <p><i>Match setup and scheduling</i></p>
            <p>
                Score5al allows the match schedule for a Sur5al event to be 
                prepared in advance and can display the schedule for any given
                heat using the scoreboard window. The software can also 
                automatically generate a match schedule based on the desired 
                numbers of teams, heats and jams.
            </p>
            <p><i>Match scoring</i></p>
            <p>
                In addition to displaying the scores during each jam, Score5al
                records the results and automatically updates the overall match 
                scores in real time. The results table can be shown in the 
                scoreboard window at any time. 
            </p>
            <p><i>Saving and exporting</i></p>
            <p>
                Score5al allows matches to be saved and reloaded at a later date.
                Match data can also be exported to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
                file so it can be imported using spreadsheet software like 
                Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice. 
            </p>
