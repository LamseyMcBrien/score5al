            <h2>Match Tab</h2>
			<p>
				The main window's Match tab is used to set up overall match 
                parameters, such as the numbers of teams, heats and jams. 
                Configuring these parameters is normally the first step in
                setting up a match in Score5al; you should exercise care when
                changing match parameters for a match which has already been 
                set up.

                <i>Score5al's match-editing tab</i>
            </p>
      
            <p><b>Match parameters</b></p>
            <p>
                To make changes to the match parameters, simply edit the desired
                field(s) and press the 'Commit Changes' button. Note that your
                changes don't take effect until you click this button. See below
                for a description of what each parameter means.
            </p>
            <p><i>Match name</i></p>
            <p>
                You should set this to the official name of your Sur5al event,
                such as "Summer Sur5al Remix". This text will be displayed at
                the top of the scoreboard window next to the Sur5al logo.
            </p>
            <p><i>Number of teams</i></p>
            <p>
                Set this to the number of teams who will be taking part in your
                event. When reducing the number of teams, the teams with the
                highest numbers will be deleted, so be careful if you are 
                changing a match where the schedule has already been created.
            </p>
            <p><i>Number of heats</i></p>
            <p>
                Set this to the number of heats in your event. The jams in the
                match will be distributed evenly between the heats; Score5al
                does not support match schedules with arbitrary numbers of jams
                per heat. If you change the number of heats in a match where the 
                jam schedule has already been configured, the jam order will be
                preserved when redistributing the jams between heats.
            </p>
            <p><i>Number of jams</i></p>
            <p>
                By default, each team in a Sur5al event plays every other team
                once; however, you may change this if desired. You can either 
                select a custom number of times for each team to play each other
                team, or you may select a completely abritrary number of jams.
                Note that using the latter option will result in an unfairly
                balanced jam schedule and is not recommended for competitive 
                play. When reducing the number of jams, the appropriate number 
                of jams are removed from the end of the match schedule. 
            </p>
            <p><i>Jam duration</i></p>
            <p>
                By default, jams last 120 seconds (2 minutes). If your event 
                uses a different jam duration, you can change it using this 
                control. Any jams which have not yet been started will be 
                updated to have the new duration.
            </p>
