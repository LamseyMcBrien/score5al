            <h2>Jams Tab</h2>
			<p>
				The main window's Jams tab is used during a match to select the
                jam or heat being displayed in the scoreboard window, to control
                the jam timer, and to update the scores for each team.

                <i>Score5al's jam-editing tab</i>
            </p>
      
            <p><b>Jam selection</b></p>
            <p>
                The controls at the top of the screen are used to select the
                jam to be displayed in the Jams panel. If the scoreboard window
                is in Jam Mode or Schedule mode, it is also affected by the jam
                selection controls in the Jams panel. During the match, the
                jam which is currently in progress should normally be the one
                which is selected.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Jam timer</b></p>
            <p>
                During each jam, the timer should be started and stopped as the
                whistle is blown by the referee. This will show the time 
                remaining in the centre of the scoreboard window when it is in 
                Jam Mode. In the event of timeouts or any time adjustments which
                may occur, you can manually change the time remaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: for the purposes of match scoring, a jam is only 
                considered to be completed if the jam timer has reached 0 
                seconds. Any jam with a non-zero value for the jam timer does 
                not contribute to the teams' match scores. This allows Score5al
                to distinguish between a no-score draw and a jam which has not
                yet taken place.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Scoring</b></p>
            <p>
                During the jam, the scores and lead jammer status for each team
                should be updated as events unfold on the track. There are 
                quick buttons to add points in increments of 4 and 5, for when
                jammers pass complete packs at once. For the benefit of both 
                players and spectators, it is recommended that points are 
                updated immediately, rather than at the end of the jam. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A warning will be displayed if points have been awarded in a jam
                but the lead jammer status has not been set; this is to ensure 
                that the LJ status is not accidentally left unset. If points 
                have genuinely been awarded without either team gaining LJ 
                status, this warning may be ignored.
            </p>
