            <h2>Teams Tab</h2>
			<p>
				The main window's Teams tab is used to set up the details of the
                teams taking part in your event, such as their name and colours.
                It is also used to apply any necessary adjustments to a team's 
                match score (e.g. to apply penalties).
			</p>
            <p align="center">
                <img src="teams.jpg" /><br />
                <i>Score5al's team-editing tab</i>
            </p>
      
            <p><b>Team details</b></p>
            <p>
                To make changes to a team's details, select it in the table and
                make your changes using the controls at the bottom of the panel.
                Once finished, press the 'Commit Changes' button - note, your
                changes don't take effect until you click this button! See below
                for a description of what each parameter means.
            </p>
            <p><i>Abbreviation</i></p>
            <p>
                If a team has a long name, you may optionally set an abbreviated
                version here, which will be displayed anywhere in the UI where
                the full name won't fit. For example, if a team's full name is
                "Bournemouth Bouncing Bombshells", this text is too long to 
                be displayed in the scoreboard window and will be truncated; you
                should set their abbreviation to a shorter name, such as 
                "Bombshells", which can be displayed instead where necessary.
            </p>
            <p><i>Colours</i></p>
            <p>
                Every team has two colours - a background colour and a foreground
                colour. These colours are used when displaying a team's name in 
                the scoreboard window. You should set the background colour to
                the team's primary kit colour, and the foreground colour to their
                secondary kit colour. <b>Hint:</b> for best readability, use 
                highly contrasting colours; dark backgrounds and light 
                foregrounds, and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p><i>Points Adjustment</i></p>
            <p>
                This field allows you to apply bonuses or penalties to a team's
                match score, such as a two-point match score penalty for a 
                penalty box infraction by a jammer. To apply a points bonus, set
                this to a positive value; to apply a penalty, set this to a 
                negative value. For example, a team that has received two 
                2-point penalties should have a points adjustment value of -4.
            </p>
