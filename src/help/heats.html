            <h2>Heats Tab</h2>
			<p>
				The main window's Heats tab is used to set up the match schedule
                by assigning teams to the jams in each heat. You can either set
                up the schedule manually, or Score5al can do it for you 
                automatically.

                <i>Score5al's heat-editing tab</i>
            </p>
      
            <p><b>Manual assignment</b></p>
            <p>
                If you want to set up your match schedule manually, simply 
                select the heat you want to edit using the controls at the top
                of the Heats panel, and then assign the teams in each jam by 
                clicking the team names in the table. Once you have finished,
                you should click the "Commit changes" button to save your 
                changes; note that selecting another heat will discard any 
                uncommitted changes.
            </p>
            
            <a name="autoassign"></a>
            <p><b>Automatic assignment</b></p>
            <p>
                To automatically generate a match schedule, use the
                controls at the bottom of the Heats panel to select the maximum 
                number of teams in a heat, and then press the "auto-assign" 
                button. This will regenerate the entire match schedule - i.e.
                the teams will be reassigned in all jams in all heats.
            </p>
            <p>
                The auto-assignment function attempts to generate a perfect 
                distribution where all teams play each other an
                equal number of times, whilst also spacing teams out as evenly
                as possible (so one team doesn't play too many jams at once).
                Depending on your match configuration, this may or may not be 
                possible; Score5al will keep trying for up to 60 seconds to 
                create a perfect distribution before giving up. It may take 
                several attempts before a perfect distribution is found. In 
                general, the lower the number of teams per heat, the harder it
                is to generate a perfect distribution.
            </p>
            
            <a name="distribution"></a>
            <p><b>Team Distribution</b></p>
            <p>
                As described above, an ideal Sur5al match schedule should ensure
                that all teams play each other the same number of times, and 
                that each team's jams are spread as evenly as possible 
                throughout the match. To help visualise this, you can show a 
                distribution table by selecting the "Show Distribution" option
                from the "Match" menu.
            </p>
            <p align="center">
                <img src="distribution.jpg" /><br />
                <i>Score5al's team distribution dialogue</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The numbers in the table represent the total number of jams 
                played by each team at the end of each heat. A number is only 
                displayed if a team participates in a heat. This allows you to 
                visualise the gaps in each team's involvement in the heat 
                schedule, as well as the number of jams they have played at any 
                given stage relative to the other teams. Ideally, each 
                team's involvement in the match should be spread out as evenly
                as possible from start to finish.
